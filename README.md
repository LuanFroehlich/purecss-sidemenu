# Pure.css Web Components Menu

Website template based on https://purecss.io/layouts/side-menu/ . The most important improvement is to share the menu as Web Components

Demo is availabel here: https://cm3.github.io/purecss-webcomponentsmenu/

## Design policy

- Implement a responsive menu which is written separately as a web component.
- Support latest Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, Safari and IE including mobile browsers. You don't need to support old IE.
- Keep simple and depend on popular and light-weight libraries only.
- Especially, keep js concise and readable.
